<h2> About me</h2>
    
<P1> Hi! I’m a multimedia journalist with two and a half years of professional experience working for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), where I had more than 180 bylines in addition to regularly contributing to TV and radio programming. Currently, I’m completing my Master’s degree at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism specializing in Sports Media. Recently, I travelled down to Arizona to cover the 2025 Waste Management Phoenix Open, where I had five stories published in The Arizona Republic.  </P1>
